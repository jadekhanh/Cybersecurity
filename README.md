### Cybersecurity:
This repository covers several cryptography methods, including caesar cipher, substition, and XOR, and one security side-channel attack.

## Caesar cryptography
The Caesar cipher, also known as the Caesar shift or Caesar's code, is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption in the field of cryptography. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This shift is called the "key" or "shift value." The method is named after Julius Caesar, who is historically believed to have used it for confidential communication.

## Substitution cryptography
A substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext

## XOR cryptography
In cryptography, the XOR cipher is a type of additive cipher, an encryption algorithm that operates according to the XOR operations. 

## Side-channel timing attack
Side-channel timing attacks based on measuring how much time various computations (such as, say, comparing an attacker's given password with the victim's unknown one) take to perform.
