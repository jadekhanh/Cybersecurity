# Cryptography
This repository provides an in-depth exploration of various cryptographic methods and security-related topics within the field of cybersecurity. It covers encryption techniques such as the Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, and XOR encryption, along with an implementation of side-channel timing attack.

## Caesar Cryptography
The Caesar cipher, also known as the Caesar shift or Caesar's code, is one of the most basic and ancient encryption methods employed in cryptography. It belongs to the category of substitution ciphers. In this technique, each letter within the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions, either up or down the alphabet. This numerical shift is referred to as the "key" or "shift value." The cipher derives its name from Julius Caesar, who is historically believed to have utilized it for confidential communication purposes.

## Substitution Cryptography
Substitution cryptography is a fundamental technique used for encryption. In this method, units of plaintext, such as individual letters, are replaced with corresponding ciphertext elements. The mapping between plaintext and ciphertext units is determined by a specific substitution rule or algorithm.

## XOR Cryptography
XOR cryptography represents a category of additive ciphers within the field of cryptography. This encryption algorithm operates based on the XOR operation, which is a binary operation known for its simplicity and efficiency. XOR cryptography involves applying the XOR operation between the plaintext and a key to generate the ciphertext.

## Side-Channel Timing Attack
Side-channel timing attacks are a class of security vulnerabilities that exploit information leaked through unintended channels, such as the time it takes for certain computations to execute. In particular, side-channel timing attacks involve measuring the execution time of specific operations, often in the context of password comparisons. By analyzing these timing differences, attackers can gain insights into the system's internal workings and potentially deduce sensitive information, such as passwords.
